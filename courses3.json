This hybrid course is intended to provide the dental hygiene student with an overview of the broad field of public health. Topics include the sciences of public health, the controversial nature of public health, powers and responsibilities of the government, social and behavioral factors in health, environmental issues in public health, medical care and public health, and public health challenges in the upcoming century. The course serves as a foundation for DENH 412. The course will also provide students with experiences that foster positive attitudes and behaviors regarding their responsibility to care for underserved populations, thereby providing insights on the impact of social and economic factors on dental health. Field experiences place emphasis on special populations, including elementary school children; geriatric, institutionalized and hospitalized clients; and individuals with mental and/or physical disabilities. The course and its field experiences will prepare the dental hygienist for the role of dental public health practitioner, educator and consultant, as well as a resource person in community settings." },{"term":"Summer 2015", "AP":"201530", "crn":"32899", "subject":"SEDP", "course_number":"651", "section":"C90", "subject_desc":"Special Ed & Disability Policy", "title":"TOP:CHAR OF STUD W/SVR DSBLTS", "instructor":"Donna Gilles", "mode":"Entirely Online", "mode_desc":"Apart from a possible face-to-face orientation or in-person exam, the instructor and students use electronic means to interact 100% of the time.

This is a course-based, credit-bearing educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets community-identified needs. Students are assigned rotations in clinical practice settings in underserved areas, in which they are exposed to patients of varied ethnic, socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds, as well as special patient populations not typically encountered in the School of Dentistry clinics. While continuing clinical education, students have the opportunity to make oral health care more accessible to marginalized groups. Throughout this unique learning experience, students are exposed to the potential benefits of practice in public health dentistry.
